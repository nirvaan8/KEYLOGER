🛡️ Consented Keystroke Capture Tool (Educational Only)

This project is a simple, consent-based keystroke capture application built using Python and Tkinter.
It is designed strictly for educational purposes, cybersecurity awareness, and user-consented input testing.

Unlike malicious keyloggers, this tool is transparent, non-stealthy, and captures keystrokes only when the application window is focused.

✨ Features

Captures keystrokes only inside the Tkinter window.

Displays captured keys in real time within the UI.

Logs keystrokes to a local file using secure file handling.

Includes timestamps for every key press.

Fully transparent — no background execution, no persistence.
